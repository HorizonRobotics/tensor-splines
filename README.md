## Development Environment

There are two `devShell` that you can invoke to get a development environment.

1. For the pure Nix-based development environment, run

   ```bash
   $ nix develop
   ```
   
2. For `poetry`-based development environment, run

   ```bash
   $ nix develop .#poetry
   ```

   And you will have the command `poetry`. The rest should follow your normal poetry workflow.
